------------------
Example of how to optimize a simple trading strategy (buy when a stock rises above its moving average, hold cash otherwise). Shows how to speed up parameter testing by using the IPython parallel processing functionality. Moves from a single stock to the entire current Dow Jones Industrial Average. Some interesting plots showing how optimal parameters vary by stock.
